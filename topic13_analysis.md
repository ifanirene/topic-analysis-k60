# Topic 13: Vascular Development and Endothelial Specialization

## Overview
Topic 13 represents a gene signature strongly associated with vascular development, endothelial specialization, and vessel patterning. The gene set includes key endothelial markers, angiogenic regulators, and factors involved in vessel specification and maturation.

## Key Functional Groups

### Endothelial Identity
- Core Markers: Cdh5, Gja4, Gja5, Sox18
- Surface Proteins: Vcam1, Icam2, Alcam
- Transcription Factors: Gata6, Meox2, Notch1

### Angiogenic Regulation
- Growth Factors: Vegfc, Pdgfd, Gas6
- Receptors: Bmx, Npr2, Npr3
- Signaling Modulators: Dll4, Jag1, Nrarp

### Vascular Patterning
- Guidance: Efnb2, Efna1, Efna5, Robo1
- ECM Components: Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1
- Matrix Organization: Htra1, Timp2, Fbln5

### Endothelial Specialization
- Junction Proteins: Cldn5, Tjp1, Kirrel
- Transport: Slc45a4, Slc4a4, Slc12a7
- Metabolism: Me1, Gls, Pld1

## Biological Interpretation
This topic captures a specialized program of vascular development and endothelial differentiation. The strong representation of arterial-venous specification genes (Efnb2, Gja5) alongside angiogenic factors suggests roles in vessel patterning and specialization. The presence of multiple junction and transport proteins indicates mature endothelial function.
