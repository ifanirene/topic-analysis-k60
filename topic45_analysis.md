## Biological Interpretation
This topic appears to capture a developmental program involved in peripheral nerve development and myelination. The presence of key Schwann cell markers (Mpz, Sox10) alongside neuronal guidance molecules suggests active neuron-glia communication. The strong ECM signature indicates the importance of the extracellular environment in supporting proper neural development and function.

## Clinical Relevance
The genes in this topic are relevant to:
1. Peripheral neuropathies (Mpz, Pmp22 mutations)
2. Neural development disorders
3. Nerve regeneration and repair
4. Potential therapeutic targets for neurological conditions
