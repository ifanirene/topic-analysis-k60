# Topic 23: Inflammatory Response and Vascular Adaptation

## Overview
Topic 23 represents a gene signature strongly associated with inflammatory response, vascular adaptation, and tissue homeostasis. The gene set includes key inflammatory mediators, vascular response genes, and regulators of tissue adaptation.

## Key Functional Groups

### Inflammatory Response
- Cytokines/Receptors: Il1r1, Il6ra, Il6st, Il34
- Chemokines: Ccl19, Ccl21a
- Acute Phase: Lcn2, Crp, Lrg1, Cfh

### Vascular Adaptation
- Endothelial Markers: Vcam1, Icam1, Clec14a

- Regulators: Nfkbia, Txnip, Fkbp5

### Tissue Adaptation
- ECM Components: Col6a6, Tnc
- Matrix Modifiers: Tgm2, Pla2g4a
- Cell Adhesion: Cd9, Cd200, Pcdh7

## Biological Interpretation
This topic captures a comprehensive program of inflammatory response and vascular adaptation. The strong representation of inflammatory mediators alongside vascular response genes suggests coordinated tissue adaptation to stress. The presence of multiple stress response factors indicates active cellular adaptation mechanisms.
