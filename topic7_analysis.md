# Topic 7: Vascular Development and Angiogenic Signaling

## Overview
Topic 7 represents a gene signature strongly associated with vascular development, angiogenesis, and endothelial cell function. The gene set includes key angiogenic factors, endothelial markers, and regulators of vessel formation and maturation.

## Key Functional Groups

### Endothelial Identity
- Core Markers: Cdh5, Tek, Sox17, Kdr
- Surface Proteins: Procr, Ly6a, Cd2ap
- Transcription Factors: Gata2, Epas1, Zeb2

### Angiogenic Signaling
- Growth Factors: Vegfc, Pdgfa, Pdgfd
- Receptors: Flt1, Kdr, Bmx
- Signaling Regulators: Smad6, Plcg2, Prkg1

### Vascular Morphogenesis
- ECM Components: Lama1, Col18a1, Col4a1, Col4a2
- Guidance: Sema3g, Unc5b, Efnb2
- Junction Proteins: Tjp1, Gja1, Gja4, Ocln

### Cell Metabolism and Transport
- Transporters: Slc2a1, Slc6a6, Slc16a1
- Metabolism: Glul, Gpd2, Pgm2l1
- Lipid Processing: Sgms1, Sgms2, Plpp1

## Biological Interpretation
This topic captures a comprehensive program of vascular development and angiogenesis. The strong representation of both early (Vegfc, Flt1) and late (Tek, Cdh5) endothelial markers suggests roles throughout vessel development. The presence of multiple ECM and guidance molecules indicates active vessel patterning and maturation.
